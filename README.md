Built a responsive Contact Form &amp; To-Do List web app using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. Features include elegant pastel UI, form validation with instant feedback, and task add/delete functionality. This project strengthened my frontend &amp; UI/UX skills in creating clean, user-friendly designs.
